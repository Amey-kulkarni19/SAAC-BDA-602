# Predictive Modeling of Late Delivery Risk

### What this is about  

In this project, we explore the application of machine learning to logistic and supply chain management. More specifically, we focus on how businesses can develop predictive models to assess and project late order delivery risk. Thus, we believe our research and findings can help improve efficiency, profitability, and market competitiveness. We used the dataset “DataCo Smart Supply Chain For Big Data Analysis,” which is publicly available on Mendeley Data, and Kaggle. The dataset contains 53 features and over 100,000 rows, documenting business, and customer transactions across the globe. 

### How to Run

Make sure you have the following python libraries installed in your device.
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. sklearn
5. scipy
6. Matplotlib

Make sure that the dataset and is in appropriate place (depends on whether you're using Collab or Jupyter Notebook.)
Based on that you may have to change the file path on first line of cell 2
